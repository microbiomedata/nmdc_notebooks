# Proteomic Data Aggregation and Visualization

This folder includes two notebooks (in R and Python) that demonstrate the aggregation of proteomic data via National Microbiome Data Collaborative's [Runtime API](https://api.microbiomedata.org/docs). They also provide an example proteomic analysis and a method of connecting the results to other datasets in NMDC. 

## R
Coming soon!

## Python
- [Static rendered Jupyter notebook](https://nbviewer.org/github/microbiomedata/nmdc_notebooks/blob/main//proteomic_aggregation/python/proteomic_aggregation.ipynb). This is the recommended way to interact with the notebook. _Viewing only, not editable_
- [![Open In Colab]((https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microbiomedata/nmdc_notebooks/blob/main//proteomic_aggregation/python/proteomic_aggregation.ipynb). **Running this notebook in the colab interactive environment is not recommended due to long API calls** _You need a google account to use this option_
