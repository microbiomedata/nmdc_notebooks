# Exploring the Bio-Scales metadata 

This folder includes two notebooks, in R and Python, that explore the chemical metadata associated with the [Bio-Scales microbiome project](https://data.microbiomedata.org/details/study/nmdc:sty-11-r2h77870)  using the [NMDC-runtime API](https://api.microbiomedata.org/docs#/metadata/list_from_collection_nmdcschema__collection_name__get).  In particular, these notebooks find the study id for this project and associated biosamples, pull associated metadata and explore the chemical metadata.
