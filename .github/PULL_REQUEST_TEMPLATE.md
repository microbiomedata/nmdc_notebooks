### Guidance for creating links to notebooks in the README.md
* To create a Colab link for your notebook for review, use the following format:
    ```
    https://colab.research.google.com/github/microbiomedata/nmdc_notebooks/blob/your_branch/folder1/folder2/your_notebook.ipynb
    ```
    Replace `your_branch` with the branch name, `folder1` and `folder2` with the path to your notebook folder, and `your_notebook.ipynb` with the name of your notebook file.

* To create a nbviewer link for your notebook for review, use the following format:
    ```
    https://nbviewer.org/github/microbiomedata/nmdc_notebooks/blob/your_branch/folder1/folder2/your_notebook.ipynb
    ```
    Replace `your_branch` with the branch name, `folder1` and `folder2` with the path to your notebook folder, and `your_notebook.ipynb` with the name of your notebook file.
