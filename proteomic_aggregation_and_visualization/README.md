# Proteomic Data Aggregation and Visualization

This folder includes two notebooks (in R and Python) that the aggregation of proteomic data via National Microbiome Data Collaborative's [Runtime API](https://api.microbiomedata.org/docs). They also provide an example proteomic analysis and a method of connecting the results to other datasets in NMDC.
